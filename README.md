**Digital Craftsman | Web Developer | Photographer**

🚀 I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering from R.M.K Engineering College in May 2024. My journey in tech began with a deep fascination for web and app development, which I honed during an internship in Java Web Development at DLK Career Development. Alongside this, I ventured into artificial intelligence through a virtual experience with Cognizant, which enhanced my versatility as a developer.

💻 Technologies I work with:

- Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- Back-End: Node.js (MERN Stack in Progress)
- App Development: Flutter, Dart (Cross-Platform Development)
- Cloud & DevOps: Basics of Docker, Git, Cloud Services
- AI/ML: TensorFlow (Learning Phase)

🌟 What drives me? Creating seamless digital experiences is my passion. Whether it's crafting responsive websites, developing cross-platform apps, or experimenting with AI models, I'm driven by the challenge to innovate and improve. I am a lifelong learner, continuously expanding my skills to keep up with the evolving tech landscape.

🔭 What am I working on? I'm currently diving deeper into the MERN stack to broaden my full-stack development capabilities, while also sharpening my cloud computing skills. My GitHub is a growing collection of projects that reflect my journey—from simple web pages to more complex applications.

🌱 Let's connect! I'm always open to collaboration, learning opportunities, and exciting projects. Feel free to explore my repositories or reach out to discuss how we can create something amazing together.
